PROJECT 1

1. run server by typing the following with user 
specified port number(without arrow)
--> python chatServer.py <port number>

Note: will ask for user specified name, then wait for clients

2. type chmod +x makefile
2. type 'makefile' (without quotes) to compile client

3. type the following with specified host and port number(without arrow).
The host should match the flip server that chatServer is on, and
the port should match chatServer.py port 
--> chatClient <host> <port>

Note: I tested on flip1 and flip3, where I ran the server
on the flip1 and then client on flip3

4.  Client sets name and must send first message to server
